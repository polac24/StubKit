### Stubbing


### Automatic stubbing


### Strict Stubbing

StubKit's term "strict stubbing" means that body of a protocol function has to be explicitly defined (registered) before it is ever called during test scenario. Any call to a stubbed function that hasn't been registerd crashes the test. Stubbing could be a part of strict mock implementation, where test scenario has to manually specify which functions are allowed to be called during test. 

```swift
protocol Database {
func addUser(name: String) -> Bool
}
class DatabaseMock: Database {
lazy var addUserAction = strictStub(of: addUser)
func addUser(name: String) {
return addUserAction(name)
}

/// Testcase

// no registration
databaseMock.addUser(name: "user1") // crash ðŸ’¥

// automaticÂ registration
databaseMock.addUserAction = registerStub(alwaysReturn: true)
databaseMock.addUser(name: "user1") // OK âœ…

// manual registration
databaseMock.addUserAction = { _ in
return false
}
databaseMock.addUser(name: "user1") // OK âœ…
```

> Strict stubbing is very restrictive so it recommended to prefer standard/nice stubbing instead.


## Limitations

- Generic functions
- Variadic functions
